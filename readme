# 🗒️ Notes App

A full-stack notes-taking application powered by a containerized Node.js + MySQL backend, and a lightweight static frontend. Built with 💚 for simplicity, modularity, and local-first workflows.

---

## 📦 Backend (Dockerized)

The backend is fully containerized using **Docker Compose** and includes:

- **Node.js (Express)**: REST API server
- **MySQL 8.0**: Relational database
- **Adminer**: Browser-based DB management UI

### 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Techies-John/todolist
   cd todolist
   Start backend services:
   ```

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This spins up:

MySQL at localhost:3306

Node.js API at localhost:3000

Adminer at localhost:8080

<pre><code>###🌐 API Endpoints
Method Route Description
GET /api/get-note Fetch all notes
POST /api/add-note Add a new note
💾 Default MySQL Credentials
Database: app_db
</code></pre>

User: app_user

Password: app_pass

🎨 Frontend (Non-Dockerized)
The frontend is a static HTML/CSS setup you can preview using Live Server or any HTTP server.

🔧 Usage
Open the index.html or new-note.html file via Live Server.

Submit new notes via the form.

Data is posted directly to http://localhost:3000/api/add-note.

> Note: Ensure the backend is running before submitting the form!
